# CODE_CHALLANGE
As the next steps, we'd like to invite you to complete our iOS challenge. You can start it at any time, but you have 10 working hours to complete from the time you receive this email. This challenge is designed to test your ability to build smooth, stable, and beautiful apps with Swift and a deep understanding of UIKit. No further action is needed on your end.   Your task is to design the mock-ups attached in the zip file using programmatic UI (No storyboards) from scratch. Feel free to add in your own creative spin onto the designs. You will be tested on the design principles, UI, code structure, and other industry-standard practices. You are open to choose any library and architecture of your choice.
